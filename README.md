## Motivation for the Project

According to CDC, you may have some side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccination such as pain, redness, swelling on the arm and tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea throughout the rest of your body. In this project, I am using Twitter data to find how common or rare are the side effects after the vaccine as shared by Twitter users.

## Libraries
Python Version: Python 3.6.9
Import libraries: nltk, pandas, preprocessor, re, itertools, collections, matplotlib.pyplot

## Summary of Results

The percentages of each side effect is found in the analysis. The results can be found in detail here: https://medium.com/@neslihanbisgin/mining-twitter-to-explore-the-odds-of-having-side-effects-after-covid-vaccine-4c3f0f35392c

## Necessary Acknowledgements

The data is downloaded from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets
Feel free to modify and use the code for your projects.
