Questions:

    What is the possiblity that your shot is largely uneventful or which side effects are more rare/common?

    Can social media aid as a way to track rare/unknown side effects? (National healthcare officials are taking each and every report of adverse side effects seriously â€” a major reason why the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is currently on pause following 6 incidents of extremely rare blood clotting.)



Ideas

    Social media data can produce rich and useful insights that were previously impossible in both scale and extent.

    I applied natural language processing (NLP) to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 vaccine side effects using data from Twitter.
